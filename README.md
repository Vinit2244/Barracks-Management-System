# Barracks Management System

Welcome to the Barracks Management System developed as a part of the Data and Applications course project in the 3rd semester. This project aims to streamline barracks management by implementing a Database Management System (DBMS) using MySQL and Python.

## Project Overview

The Barracks Management System allows users to perform various operations related to barracks management through a Command-Line Interface (CLI). The implemented functionalities include:

- **Insert**: Add new records to the database.
- **Search**: Retrieve information from the database based on specified criteria.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Analysis**: Conduct data analysis on the stored information.

## Setup

Run the following command to install pymysql library

> ```pip install pymysql```

## Features

- **MySQL Database**: Utilized to store and manage barracks-related information.
- **Python CLI**: Implemented a Command-Line Interface for user interaction.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
- **Analysis Tools**: Basic data analysis features to derive insights from the stored data.
