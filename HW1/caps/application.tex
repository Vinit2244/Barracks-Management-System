This database stores all the information about the restaurant related to its staff, reviews, orders, bills, feedbacks, grocery, salary etc. which all can be used to run the restaurant efficiently and ensure good service to the customers. Some software can extract out the reviews information from the database and show the overall rating of the restaurant to the customers so that they can take their decision based on this. The managers and head chefs can take a peek on the storage of vegetables, spices and all and decide when do they want to place some order. The manager can decide whether give some increment/decrement or recruit/fire some staff (based on their customer feedback). The information about the revenue being generated can be inferred.
